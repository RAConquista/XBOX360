# Tanks 360

i decided to take a foray into the Libxenon world and created a game.  
 This is built using ZLX from Ced2911 and LibXenon from the Libxenon folks.  
   
 The engine is built entirely from me, and sprites are all from public domain at this point.

 It's very WIP but will be updated as i have time. Hoping this will help get others interested, it shows you can create games.  
 [quote] This is going to get flushed out more.  
   
 For now, i decided to work on creating an engine / game from scratch made in and from libxenon and lzx.  
 This is still very basic much more to come.  
   
 Thanks to libxenon team.  
 Thanks to Ced2911, Cancerous, Tuxuser for Libxenon / LZX / Encouragement  
 Thanks to Blackwolf for the upcoming music  
 Thanks to Mattie for the idea  
 Thanks to STK50 for all you have done. Hope one day to work with you again. [/quote] edit by tux: README && binary package attached
