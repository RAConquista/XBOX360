 i have to excuse myself...  
   
 i havent noticed the usb-hub plugged into my 360... this seems to have caused all the trouble...

exactly!  
 i tryed an .bin image of "RC Stuntheli"... its possibly ntsc, does this matter?  
 trying now to convert that to iso...

peet you don't need to convert, .iso, .bin, .img all should work

 try another game, ive booted .img .iso and bin file type without any problem. some games that are not support it yet can give you black screen so it may be compatibility issue. try another game ;)

i have formated my external hdd to fat32 and it works...  
   
 seems there is some mess with usb device compatibility...  
   
 thanks  
   
   
 edit:  
 theres still strange stuff going on... emu freezes, hdd blinks and even wont stop blink when i power down the xbox :D

Ive got a falcon jtag, not using HDMI, I get to the list to select the game, but once i try to pick FF7 iso it just hangs, light on the hdd stays turned on... any reports of ff7 working good yet?? using an external 2tb drive, formatted into 2 partitions, 1st fat32, 2nd wbfs.  
   
 EDIT: fixed the issue, 1. i converted the bin to an iso(guess it didnt work well), 2. my external drive does not want to work for anything xell. shame, got 1 usb key that wont launch any elf files through xell(kingston data traveler mini 1gb) got an old lexar 2gb drive right now that im playing ff7 on. almost makes me want to invest in the 360 controller thats shaped like a ps3 controller.  
   
 any chance for usb ps3 controller support, or even the "knockoff" ps3 controllers that use a usb dongle. anyone know if that will work??  
   
 EDIT2: only issue ive come across so far with Final Fantasy 7 is when it actually saves, the whole thing slows down, music plays at like half speed. I guess this is due to the usb limitations or something, but i just want to put my findings out to help you guys with the development.  
   
 great job on the emulator, remember hearing about it a while back, glad to see it come to fruition. keep up the great work.

## 2011-08-28 22:53:27, posted by: dreamboy

final fantasy 7 works great with me without issues mine its .img file.   
   
 PS: i use vga cable on xbox360

It works for me but I have some issues.. When playing most games the video lags heavily (Crash Team Racing) and is at times, unplayable. And as shown in the video of you playing Abe's Oddysee, there are some problems with the game when you walk over certain platforms. Hope to see another update fixing these minor issues, but if not, thanks for giving us a working EMU! ;D  
   
 I'm running a jtag exploited falcon through HDMI. I don't have a regular AV cable or a VGA cable to test on, but possibly the upscaling to 720p is creating the video lag.  
   
 Thanks!

 tried more than 1 copy, both discs are mint! also tried about 6 different iso and img files of disc 1 including pal and ntsc formats, all with the same results. If you can get it to work and let me know you would be god to me, but i have had zero luck with disc 1.

it's strange  
   
 i try run Parappa The Raper on my 3,5 WD Caviar 640GB Sata3 with USB Adapter and after run i see black screen  
 on Sandisk 4GB pendrive the game work perfect  
   
 Why ?

## 2011-09-18 19:31:49, posted by: jayboy86

i too have had issues with certain usb devices. The only stick i have that works every time is a 4gb kingston, the external hdd is sometimes a bit dodgy but works most times, the official sandisk 360 sticks dont work at all even is re-formatted.

## 2011-09-29 20:49:47, posted by: antman1

I am having an odd issue with this. I can get it to load and the game looks great but has no sound. I am connected to my RGH Falcon using VGA connection with the red/white audio cable going to some pc speakers. This setup works great with the Nintendo64 emu but I cant get sound to work on this. I have tried my Sandisk 4gb stick and my external 40gb hdd. I get the same results both times and am not sure what more I can change. Any Help is appreciated.   
   
 BTW: Thank you all for the great awesome work you do. I love the Homebrew and you guys ROCK!!

Hey guys im having an issue here with PCSXR i cant seem to get it to load.. all the files are on the root of my usb and i'm loading xell by XellLaunch and everything seems to load fine... that is until it reaches ( *please wait a moment while the kernel loads ) I have tried it with the newest xell and still hangs on loading the elf file (executing file ).. Is there some fix, or am i doing something wrong here..   
   
 by the way nice work..

I am experiencing the very same error, that evildeaddc has here. It just freezes when it's about to load up. The old Pcsxr that was uploaded to logic-sunrise a while back does work though, but all the ones I tried to build myself freezes. Where did you get yours, evildeaddc?

## 2011-09-30 18:16:21, posted by: jayboy86

evildeaddc and warfaren  
   
 when you finish your compile of the emulator, you should have two files. make sure that you use the .ELF32 file, not the .ELF  
   
 take the .elf32, rename it to xenon.elf and try that file.  
   
 should fix your issue, let me know how it goes

I actually downloaded the one linked in the first post 5.1 hdmi fix.. but it refuses to boot, tried building one from the source code linked on the first post also and it fails at ( gamecube\_plugins.h fatal error: Decode\_XA.h no such file or directory ) anyhow thanks..

 [/quote]  
   
 You can get the newest release from the github, the problem you are having is just with capitilization, there are 3 files which need to be fixed. It is only like that for linux users, because Decode\_XA.h and decode\_xa.h are two different files in linux, you can either change each instance of that error as it comes, search and replace , or make a copy of the needed files, rename them properly and then place them back in the same folder next to the originals, this is what I did, because in some cases it looks for decode\_xa.h the others are PSEmu\_plugin** and r3000A.h  
   
 The newest build will require some additional libs but doesn't have the case problem. Hope that helps.

## 2011-10-01 02:22:11, posted by: evildeaddc

Thanks Juggahaxor the updated source from github.com/Ced2911/pcsxr-xenon worked like a charm.. Plus it booted on Gliglis updated xell.. Keep up the good work guys..

Oh. Once again I'm on my own with the error I'm having then :(

 hey warfaren if you downloaded the newest source and compiled it yourself with no problem.. then the fault lies with the usb.. I had a similar problem besides the emu's elf file not loading.. I just formatted the usb flash drive to FAT32 ( full format NOT quick format ) placed zlx browser.elf as xenon.elf on usb root and booted xell reloaded (Gliglis updated xell) to test it.. This should pretty much fix it, along with using elf32 file from compile pcsxr source... on a side note I cant seem to boot breath of fire 4 on pcsxr it stays on a red screen.. loading I think.. :)

## 2011-10-03 01:04:45, posted by: warfaren

I suppose I'll experiment more with it.  
 Although I've already tried to load it from 3 different USB devices, all formatted with FAT32.  
 All get the exact same error and they do manage to load other stuff fine (such as mupen64 for example, as well as older versions of pcsxr such as the one available on logic-sunrise)

## 2011-10-03 03:54:02, posted by: jayboy86

having trouble also, previous release would load many files but this release wont load any. im sure ced2911 s hard at work so be patient, a new update will be here in no time. keep up the great work ced2911

## 2011-10-07 10:41:05, posted by: ifearnoevil41

i am having the same trouble as others when i load xell reloaded with xenon.elf it freezes at the kernal loading.... it acts like it tries to load it then freezes.... i have a usb in FAT32 and the correct xenon.elf.... i see others putting down that you have to compile things and also i saw that there was another thing to download from github.com/Ced2911/pcsxr-xenon... what does this do and what do people mean by compiling..

Hey Yeah Theres Always Bugs guys..i bet Ced is already working hard as it is.100% everytime i use the Old Xell Reloaded the first build.Works like a charm.Using the 23rd of september release i cant seem to get working.Most Roms have worked a charm.Some Laggy in video tested in HDMI and the Xbox HD scart.However Just be glad there is one atm.If you guys think you could increase the stability in this.PM me and ill help.So Use the 1st Build of Xell Reloaded and should work

Thank you very much for this information! I will give it a try and see how it works for me. I had a question though... I was wondering if anyone is having problems getting sound through HDMI? I am trying to run the HDMI out to my [url=http://www.klipsch.com/home-theater-systems]surround sound system[/url] but have not had any luck with it. Please let me know if you can help me with this. Thank you!

I'm a complete prat when it comes to explaining stuff, and not sure if this is mentioned elsewhere. But the sound is working over HDMI for me. Not sure if this is news for anyone (been up for since 6am (now 1.35am) and am just a bit tired :P).

 the make install stuff was only for installing the bzip2 libraries so that you can successfully compile this emu...

Thanks warfen. It up and running now, using the version that came with the precompiled vmware image of debian posted here. However I get a red screen when trying to load a game. I havent tried any other games but tried the same game in bin and ISO format. Both just gave me the red screen. I tried to compile using the latest source, but the makefile produced many errors. I am wondering if it I need to update Xenon-Toolchain and LibXenon to newer versions as well? Maybe my bzip2 source needs updated? Heres some of the out put:

i've been trying to run PCSXR. but it ALWAYS seems to freeze on the first screen. (the blue with the file explorer)  
 or maybe no freezing but a controller ISSUE? its a Wireless Controller, i dont have any wired one.  
 im on HDMI, but on normal A/V it freezes too.  
   
 its a SLIM 4GB RGH, XeLL test 01/02/2012 through XeLL-Launch (using the one on the onboard flash its the same, freeze).

Using a wireless controller it should be fine, only wired freezes for me.  
 What version of pcsxr are you using though?

## 2012-01-15 19:25:57, posted by: Ethereal

Well, just to do some testing report.  
   
 I do have sound over HDMI with PCSXR-Xenon.   
   
 Now playing Final Fantasy 8.

Im new really but thought i would share my experiance on this and im sure its nothing new but just trying to help. So first off i have yet to find this emu bootable from a usb bigger than 8 gigs. i have tried multiple usb drives ranging from 16 up to 2tb and the .elf just wont execute im trying one more flash drive in a few days its in the mail. Also i at this moment do not have sound but im new and got a version that was already compiled i did not compile it myself i do not know how.(any help would be great but no big deal) As far as games go i find the tomb raider 1 and 2, like all megaman games, res evil 1, metal slug, crash 2, and smackdown are working for me as of now im testing more i just am busy i will post more games that work so people dont waste time downloading games that wont work. But i am unaware if they will run on others consoles so feedback on that would be nice. hope it helps or at least gives people an idea what to look for or expect

 First post updated

## 2012-03-04 21:56:42, posted by: chunkz

tried new version just now and xell wont boot up the .elfn32 file i know i have latest everything and a usb flash drive that does read right just in case im gonna try a new usb. anyone with similar problems or is it just me?  
   
   
 New usb still dosnt work. i even tried renaming the elf32 to just elf and that did not work. Its keeps saying trying to make sense of everything the flashes cant connect to server. why would a server even make a difference? I dont know i guess i will just have to wait for feedback on my situation

Ok well I just tested it out and this is different from what I was having problems with. Before I could actually pick a game and then it would freeze but this is different. Im sure that ced will get it worked out and that it is just a simple mistake.  
   
 Btw I am running a slim too, maybe somebody here with a phat can test it out to see if they have the same problem.

## 2012-03-05 02:40:50, posted by: chunkz

I have a phat And its a no go it dosnt freeze for me but it will not pick up the elf file at all ive tried multiple efforts i cant even get the menu up. its just a constant search for the elf file which i know is there. never had the problem with previous version or mupen64 im just at a loss  
   
   
   
 OKay so i just got it running now i get stuck when loading a game so atleast i caught up to everybody elses problem...on a side not to even get it to boot i had to rename the pcsxr-xenon.elf32 to just xenon.elf and it botted up fine but i wonder if this is why the games wont load im unsure of this but that how i got it to boot  
   
   
 Okay another edit here change the games extensions to .iso instead of .bin or .img anf games should load credit goes to mthodmn101 for figuring that out just was posted on another site not this one

## 2012-03-05 08:18:09, posted by: barnhilltrckn

Yea I cant even make it to the game select screen, as soon as I hit "load game" in the gui it just freezes up and I have to power down. Like I said it must be something to do with slims because his last released version (.51 I think) wouldnt load up at all on slims.   
   
 Hopefully he is seeing this and working something out, I have faith he will come through. I have been watching his progress like a hawk so I could play some psx on my 360. Yea I can get on my pc and play psx games full speed with absolute ZERO issues but there is just something about playing through the games I love on another system they were never meant to play on. Emulation and game ports have always been the best thing about an open console for me. Now if I could only learn to write code myself I have about 2-3 things I would love to see ported that I havent scene discussed. :P

## 2012-03-05 10:26:47, posted by: chunkz

Okay so i found now after playing with this new version for a few that when you load some(more like most) roms it seems like it freezes or shows a colorfull kinda fuzzy or lined screen if that happens( and its not frozen) press your guide button on your controller this should bring up the menu to the emu now simply just hit return to game wait for it to load again then it should run somewhat normal except for maybe loading screens if it is not running normally try this step again im running most all games i try and i have to do this a lot to load the games up hope it helps someone

this emu seems to be very picky with the flash media, one stick i use always gets the red screen another sd with usb adapter gets it about 30% of the time. I still get a lock up when selecting the game. n64 emu runs very good.

The only time i have seen that error is when my usb flash with the emu is plugged in and so is my ext. hd on a diiferent usb port i unplugged my ext. hd and the emu popped up just fine again maybe thats your guys problems i dunno i also find that many usb flash sticks are useless for this emu i prefer to use sandisk there reliable for me but it dosnt mean others wont work for other people its just my experiance with it

have you gone into the pcsxr folder and checked that you put the bios in there.....if you extarcted all files to folder it should be there if you extracted manually you may have forgot to put the bios folders in. If all else fail download again and have your pc extract to folder it puts all files in proper location.  
   
   
 Every problem i ever realy had was a good usb drive for some reason its just picky on what drives it will run on. Experiment with flash drives and your own knowledge of things. Im still a newbie to all this i had a guy hook my xbox up with all programs i needed he then failed to send me any info on how to get emus. and games or anything that makes it fun really. I now have a ridiculous amount of things from just reading these forums and experimenting myself. All you people can figure this out i mean if i can anyone can really just hang in there its called trial and error one day it will all just make sense.

I use 0.6 and I got xenon release sept 2011.  
   
 How Do I start this correctly? I renamed pcsxr-xenon.elf32 to xenon.elf and put in root and start xbox with eject button which seems to work..  
   
 When I start it says pcsxr-xenon unable to display files on selected load device  
   
 The iso is in the root of the usb wd elements hdd.. (1.5 TB)  
   
 The iso's are UNdamged and in these containers: .img .bin. iso  
   
 Wtf? what must I do?

## 2012-03-13 22:42:06, posted by: chunkz

rename your .bin or .img to .iso it must be .iso now make a folder named isos or roms put all .iso files in that folder(folder must be on root) that is what you do for games. Now as far not being able to display files on device have you tried a different usb flash drive. Some flash drives are just not compatible with this emu it seems. i use sandisk 16bg...but i have also now heard of people having problems with those too. also i always plug into the usb port in the back i wouldnt think thats an issue though.  
   
 Most deff is your usb if its 1.5tb thats your issue i havent heard of a single person getting it to boot from anything bigger than 32gigs so use a way smaller flash drive and it should display fine assuming it likes your brand of flash drive

## 2012-03-13 22:51:09, posted by: chrisssj2

I have a folder in root named roms, and it has one iso in it.  
   
 I use this external HDD for everything, XBLA, DLC, Xbox classics, GOD/extracted games, and everything works flawless soo dont understand why this emu wouldnt.  
   
 Why isnt there a simple locator option or set path in the emu -\_-

wish people would not just reiterate "it all working fine here" as far as am aware yes it works but only to a certain degree (shane really as it is by far the best emu i have seen when a game does work on it )  
 if it does work for you at least have the decency to post a list of working games you have  
 so far ones i wanted   
 hogs of war works but not really playable  
 blade not working  
 resident 2 not working  
 adidas power soccer not working  
 fifa soccer 97 not working  
 basicly so far i have only crash bandicoot 2 fully working  
 have tried all on both slim and phat

@chrisssj2  
   
 It dosnt work on huge ex. hd because of all the other files it has to go thru to even get to your xenonelf Just use a flash drive.   
   
 @jimmyc  
 I did not list games that are working and not working because nobody seemed to care to much when i did with the previoous release of this emu. If you search this forum you should find at least 20-30 games i listed as working with the previous version. Not all of those work on this version but some do i belive. I have been busy busy lately and havent had much time to go thru and see what dose and dosnt work. For now at least you have the option of downloading the previous version and going off of my previous list if you cant wait till i get a new list up.   
   
 Also when i did just get it i noticed the screen would stay black but not frozen press guide button then when it takes you to menu hit return to game and game seemed to boot after that will start working on a list now for people.

## 2012-03-14 07:59:40, posted by: jimmyc

My comment was not directed at any one individual bud more at a whole   
 I too had plenty game time on previous version but game play is far superior on latest emu just kinda sucks now down to using a 2gb pendrive and can only fit 3 games at a time on it   
 its proving a tad irksome for my lazy ass tripping back n forth to pc

## 2012-03-14 08:28:08, posted by: chunkz

I know what you mean man i didnt take it offensively lol.....i use a sandisk 16gb works fine for me thats the biggest ive been able to run with this emu thoguh  
   
 So i used that xenon elf fix on page 5 i think it was and that made evry game that did work at one point not work anymore. I re downloaded original xenonelf that came with the release and not the fix now my games are working again only have booted up 2 so far.  
   
 crash 2 works a lil glitchy but once in game runs great  
   
 batman and robin freezes at new game but boots to menu very laggy though not worth trying useless  
   
 EDIT:  
 working/ crash2/ crash3/ bubsy 3d(glitchy but runs great once ingame)/driver/frogger(glitchy but runs great once in game)/spyro 1(once game loads return to menu then returen to game and game should pop up)  
   
 NOT WORKING:  
 alien trilogy/batman and robin/batmanforever/capcom vs. snk/ dexters lab/ lion king 2/ crash bash/ gex 1 and 2

 It dosnt work on huge ex. hd because of all the other files it has to go thru to even get to your xenonelf Just use a flash drive.   
   
 @jimmyc  
 I did not list games that are working and not working because nobody seemed to care to much when i did with the previoous release of this emu. If you search this forum you should find at least 20-30 games i listed as working with the previous version. Not all of those work on this version but some do i belive. I have been busy busy lately and havent had much time to go thru and see what dose and dosnt work. For now at least you have the option of downloading the previous version and going off of my previous list if you cant wait till i get a new list up.   
   
 Also when i did just get it i noticed the screen would stay black but not frozen press guide button then when it takes you to menu hit return to game and game seemed to boot after that will start working on a list now for people.

 Erm it SHOULD work, as mupen64 and other emulators work fine like this. Another thing supporting this that I tried a 32 gb usb flash drive, and still got the SAME FREAKING ERROR. It cannot find the roms :S

@Ced2911  
   
 Need to fix displaysettings for my old tv. soi tried to change the display resolution and compiled it again, but without any changes.  
 where in the code can i change the displaysettings for the menu?  
   
 here the places, where i tried:  
 source/main/main.cpp in main() : xenos\_init(VIDEO\_MODE\_AUTO) => xenos\_init(VIDEO\_MODE\_PAL50);  
 source/main/gui.cpp in main(): xenos\_init(VIDEO\_MODE\_AUTO) => xenos\_init(VIDEO\_MODE\_PAL50);  
 source/gui/g\_video.cpp in InitVideo(): i set screenheight = 480 and screenwidth = 640;  
   
 hope you can help me, to find the right place.  
   
 btw. xell\_reloaded show me this displaysettings (640x576). ;)  
   
 **[b]EDIT[/b]**: I found the right places. It's somthing like this (1080,...).  
   
 But when i compile it and then try to start a game, it crashes an i get a red screen. :(  
 With the allready compiled version 0.6 i could start the games, only works slow.

yes i've hardcoded 1280*720 in the gui :s i'll fixing some global issues, i hope to release a new version this week :)

at moment i'm looking for the font settings, to change the size. it's too big for my tv. When i go to options or something else, then i can't see the hole text line.  
 Only found textsettings for title and buttons, but not for the content :(  
   
 Oh, for old tv's 640x480 is a good setting. I only set a x\_offset = 30, so the content starts on left without any cuts. ;D

## 2012-03-15 14:03:02, posted by: dnacid

It's very strange. I can compile PCSXR and with no errors. But when i try to start a game, it crashes and i see a red screen: "Segmentation fault!"  
 What do i wrong???  
 I loaded a clean version from GIT and compile it without any changes, but i get this damn red screen >:(  
   
 When i load the compiled version 0.6 it works, why? ???

if anyone got multiple stat definition problem at compiling the source, just coment out this at libxenon\_miss.c on the main folder: [code]/* #if 1 // miss in gligli libxenon int stat(const char * \_\_restrict path, struct stat * \_\_restrict buf) { int fd = -1; fd = open(path, O\_RDONLY); if (fd) { return fstat(fd, buf); } return ENOENT; // file doesn't exist } #endif */[/code] and Clean and compile the project again, it should compile fine after this ;)

 To be honest it really is pretty simple. http://www.libxenon.org/http://libxenon.org//viewtopic.php?t=2&nbsp; Everything you need to get started compiling libxenon code by yourself is right here. It honestly is not as hard as you think once you start trying it out for yourself. Once you get the libxenon toolchain all set up its simply a matter of going into the source's folder and typing "make". If you need any help getting it setup there isnt a shortage of people willing to help you out. Trust me on that one as I have had to talk to tuxuser several times and ced a few times, they are good people.  
   
 Also its kinda bad practice around here to upload the compiled source of other people's work unless it is a specific release by the author.

 I dont think your far off, i can get disc 2, 3 and 4 boot fine but i dont have any saved games so cant test any further. These working discs work because there is no opening video at the start, but disc 1 does have a opening video after the squaresoft logo.  
   
 is there anyway i can get a saved game for this on the usb stick and load it in the emu? what format would i need. thx for the help

## 2012-03-19 19:40:43, posted by: barnhilltrckn

I use psxmemtool for messing around with psx saves. You also have to rename the memcards that pcsxr-xenon uses from "card1.mcd" to "card1.mcr" in order for psxmemtool to transfer the save over right. Then after you do that name it back to "card1.mcd" to use on pcsxr-xenon.   
   
 The tool will read and right to mcd cards but for some reason it will not work onpcsxr-xenon unless you do it with the method I just described. If you would like me to inject the saves for you just upload the saves you want to use and I will make working cards for you. I have allready moved my FF7 saves over so I didnt have to start over either(albeit only on the 1st disc, my guys are around level 45 and only in the Nibel area :P).

 got disc 4 to boot and used memcardrex to edit a EU save i got online, worked fine apart from some game and sound lag issues but i proves that the game does work (kind of) and that the video on disc 1 is the problem. maybe this could help on a fix and could explain why alot of other later psx games do not work.  
   
 anyone have any suggestions on changing settings that may help with the game/sound lag? would be great.  
   
 thx guys.  
   
 if anyone want the save file i have for disc 4 on ff9 let me know

Well it seems that all the startup bugs have been worked out now so thats great news. Good work and thanks for all the work ced!!!  
   
 Now if we can only get fullspeed we may have a great emulator and then everyone will start to see how good libxenon really is. N64 and ps1 on the 360 with fullspeed is a pretty amazing thing imo. I just wish I could help out but sadly I am still trying to learn. I just try small and very, VERY basic edits of source code files. It isnt much but I am starting to understand the structure of it all.......atleast I think :P.

The red screen appeared when I used HW + Dynarec in the two first options at the options menu.  
 I changed to SW + Interpreter, and it ran very nice for almost an hour.  
   
 CG's have a few slows, nothing critical, i tried several different settings but couldn't make it run at full speed.  
 As soon as i can, i'll try Parasite Eve.

@ced  
   
 I see that you are getting games to run that i am not according to the compatibility list. Is there somthing i am missing like a trick to get some games running? Or maybe i just had a bad iso. Anyways i was just curious over the dramatizing difference on the couple games i saw as i couldnt get them to load at all and you had them running perfect according to list.   
   
   
   
 EDIT:  
 Nevermind i used the cdrcimg trick and some are now booting up but most still unable to play for me but no need to reply i dont think there is anything else i can do but make sure my iso's are proper.

yes try to find some proper isos.

 Ok its a VERY simple fix. Go to ced's git and download both ntfs-xenon and ext2fs-xenon. Then extract both of those to there own folder, open up a terminal, become su, cd into the folder you extracted them too(you will have to do this two seperate times for each ntfs and ext2fs)and then type: [code]make make install[/code] That should let you compile pcsxr-xenon now. Have fun!! 8)  
   
 ps: I thought ced had removed ntfs and ext2fs depencies from pcsxr-xenon. ???

 Oh ok I see what is going on..........atleast I think so :P. It seems as you may have figured it out with your edit though. I always just download either ced's, tuxuser's, or gligli's libxenon and put that in whatever folder I put decide and build the toolchain from there. If that is what you have allready done then you should be ok but if not give that a try and you should be good to go.  
   
 If you need anymore help dont be afraid to ask though. I aint the only one here that is willing to help though so if I dont see it then I am sure someone else who knows will help. Good luck.

i've been working a few more on the ff9 bug, now it's reboot (sony logo + Playstation logo) after squaresoft screen

## 2012-03-21 23:17:14, posted by: barnhilltrckn

Cool deal ced, its good to hear that you are working on this much more now. Btw what else is needed to achieve fullspeed in games like FF7 and FF9?? It seems like it should have enough power to pull it off considering how gligli's port of mupen64 run. I could be wrong but they both seem to require about the same specs to get full speed.   
   
 I havent checked out pcsx on the pc lately but from what I read on zophar.net pcsxr is supposed to be just about as good as pSX or epsxe. pSX emulator has always been my choice for the pc but sadly it is closed source. I think its sad to keep it that way considering how many things it could be ported too. Epsxe is also closed source, I wonder why they have both been kept that way. I guess I can check pcsxr out on the pc tonight to see how good it may get on the 360. I have no doubt that ced will get it up to par with the pc version though.

## 2012-03-21 23:59:08, posted by: barnhilltrckn

Ok sorry to double post but anywhoooo. What cdplugin are you using for pcsxr-xenon ced???? I only ask because I just downloaded and tested pcsxr-reloaded(thats what you are using correct??) to play ff9 on it and it loaded just fine with the cd in the drive, by just iso, and by using dameon tools to mount the iso. I didnt have any problems at all so do you think it could just be the plugin you are using?? It came with sapu's 1.3 I believe so if that is not the cd plugin you are using it might be worth a shot to try that one out to see if it does any better.  
   
 I am sure that there is something else going on that is causing it not to work but I figured I would let you know about it so you could look into it. Also btw pcsr has come a long way since I last looked at it, atleast the reloaded version is. It is right on par with the 2 emulators I mentioned my last post so if you do end up getting all the bugs worked out this will end up being a great port. I for one will be supporting you any way I can with your progress and I am sure that many others here will do the same. I'm getting kinda exited to see where this goes now. :P

 Ok well that sucks. UUhmmm how about trying this: Open up a terminal, become su, and then: [code]apt-get install libmpc-dev [/code] Then try again to setup everything again. Also make sure you are su when you are building libxenon.

you rename the file extension. when you get the game you will have an extension on it most likely .img / .bin / or .iso you then right click to edit name move cursor to extension and name the above said extesions to .cdrcimg. If you cannot edit the file extension you must go into your computer settings and make it so you can.

 Well I just tryed that and it made no differences at all. Most of ff7 is really fullspeed but it has major slowdowns while running around the worldmap. I have tryed to use the sw gpu plugin and it seems to do a much better job imo but it plays way to fast, almost like the frame limit is turned off. It even shows all the effects while going into a battle too.  
   
 Also I dont see how renaming the extension will compress the image. All that is doing is putting a different name on it, its still the same size which means it isnt compressed. I must be missing something.

 if u use the SW plugin, set cpu to interp instead of dynamic.. i was using all sorts of differant settings tryin to get 3xtreme to work.. so far settings i have found to be best are SW plug, Interp cpu, xa decoding on, and cd audio off(fixes chops in audio, atleast for iso's), along with the rest off, SPU all options enabled, GPU Framlimit on, hi-res none, GTE accuracy ON.. also i dont know if anyone else notices.. but there is 2 stretched options.. dunno if its repeated code in source or?? there is no VISUAL differenct between the 2 options, and during gameplay i havent noticed anything.. but with those options i have gotten 2xtreme, 3xtreme, twisted metal 2 to work without slowdowns, minus 3xtreme's menu is slow reguardless.. and yes JUST renaming does increase speed.. dunno how or why.. but im pretty sure there is an actual conversion supposed to happen??

I dunno why but renaming it does work for instance my batman forever would not even load as a .iso but when i changed it to .cdrcimg it ran fullspeed with no issues. Im travling right now and cant really send ced my games list right now. Right now i have 58 games that run great all in .cdrcimg format. And 34 games that dont run or have to many issues to play. I would say thats a good ratio for a beta version

 also i just noticed u reviewed twisted metal 4.. on the combatibility page.. and i was wondering did u ever press start to pause it?? once its unpaused gameplay is unplayable..  
 dont mean to flame.. just dont know if anyone else experiences this..

## 2012-03-22 22:48:13, posted by: barnhilltrckn

Well I havent seen any differences what so ever on my side. I was however able to gett ff9 to load with a save I have but as soon as it goes to load a FMV it locks up and gives me a segmentation fault like everyone else.   
   
 Hopefully ced can get some more speed out of this port and get the problem with ff9 worked out. Im telling you that if he can this will be a great psx port. I have faith he can pull it off especially considering how much support he is getting from all of us here.

## 2012-03-22 22:58:47, posted by: chunkz

I have full gameplay on twisted metel 4 just checked it again to make sure. Some of those games on that list added by me need to be edited when i first started adding to the list i was unawre of the cdrcimg trick. Try getting another version of twis. 4 and try that maybe try .iso first i believe when i tested it originally it was .iso

## 2012-03-23 00:53:55, posted by: barnhilltrckn

Well I dont play twisted metal, never liked them. The only games I really play are squaresoft titles(mostly ff series and musashi), tekken 2, gran turismo, and frogger. Other than those there isnt anything else I really like on the ps1. Im a picky player, always have been one. :P

 drag and drop the .iso on the .exe it will create a .Z and .Z.table you need the 2

thanx totally fix my issues.. onlything is that it didnt come with the .dll but that was an easy fix.. thanx ced.. i will continue to check all my games.. also if cd audio is disabled, no audio issues, like choppy-ness, when using iso's..

Ok I just got back home a little while ago and I tryed a different flash drive to see if that was my problem but its still the same. I hadnt even had the thought of trying a different flash drive but no matter what I do I just cant get rid of the slow downs in ff7.   
   
 I did try a few other games so I guess I will go put them up on the chart. Most of the games I tryed actually play great if but some still have slowdowns. I used cdrcimg to compress all the games I tryed so I know that isnt the problem. But like I keep saying, I am not worried about it all because its still a work in progress. I know before too long we will have full speed across the board with all the games and also get games like ff9 playing just as they should.   
   
 I do have one request though ced, would it be possible to have a fast forward button?? I was thinking just a button that turns off the frame limit and then push it again to turn the fframe limit back on. Maybe map it to L3 or R3, I honestly dont know of any ps1 games that use those buttons but I could be wrong. If you dont want to add that then its no biggie, its just a suggestion. Thanks for all the help you guys have tryed to give though and I doubt that it matters any at all but I am playing on a slim NOT a phat. :P

just asking is it possible to boot games from dvd/cd\_drive ? (if not would it be possible ?)  
 cause i have my old games all on ps1 cds.  
 but my ps2 drive is broken :(   
 the ps1 memory cards are still working and i have backups from all saves on HDD (and could do anytime new ones) so any way how to use these old saves on the emulator ?

Hey I'm back from vacation and caught up on work I have a decent collection to add to the list will do that in a day or two   
   
 Edit: added to list. Added only A-C of what i found compatible. Please also note that im listing everything as just "playable" while some run perfect others have a few bugs. All games i found to boot are tested at least twice with at least 30 mins of gameplay. So all these games were playable in my aspect even if they had some sound issues or some had just a little lag. Once im done adding all game i found playable i will then begin my other list of games i found unplayable.

You need the usbdevs.c  
   
 Try to recompile with it in your libxenon toolchain

 If the emulator is not dead, please add this feature, could be cool!

Thank you Ced !  
   
 But I can't launch it on my Slim RGH, its well detected to boot on the USB key, but after that, nothing happens, black screen with no signal.  
 After a while, if I press some keys, It restarts and loop again.  
   
 I tried with different keys (2GB and 8GB), and launching it from the Eject button and from DashLaunch.  
   
 I have the last Xell version.  
   
 Any idea ?

 Probably you have a corona motherboard, which requires a recompilation using the updated repo...

 I believe this is a corona too

I didn't find how to recompile the project for coronas. And I don't understand why there is not a compiled project for coronas if the problem is only to recompile it ?  
 Is it possible that someone compile it and give the archive ? That would be really great.

 give me the source code you're trying to compile and i'll do it for you, altering whatever needs to be changed for it to work... altought, using the latest libxenon should work as-is for most parts with older homebrew (without changes)  
   
 the likely reason is that there are multipile versions of this emulator out there, most of which aren't working in it's current state... (you can't even compile most of them)

I come back, cause this version 0.7 launch well on my corona, and emulation works really great on games I tested (Crash 3, CTR, Crash Bash, Spyro 1) except I still have no audio. :-\   
 I searched for some solutions, but still no sound.  
   
 Is it the last version developed from now ? I can't find the compiled version 0.7 you compiled anywhere else, it's strange if sources exists !  
 I'm so disappointed that the audio is mute, cause everything else seems perfect.  
   
 Any idea ?

Hello everyone,  
   
 Thank you swizzy by compiling pcsxr xenon for coronas . I also had the audio problem. I managed to solve by connecting the HDMI and AV at the same time . The AV cable into the home theater . I was sad because most of the games I tested did not work out . I found another version: https://github.com/Cancerous/pcsxr-xenon believe it to 0.62 . You could do a great favor to compile for the corona ?  
 Thank you my friend!!
