[quote] As a testbed, ive ported SDLQuake in parallel with libSDLXenon  
   
 SDLQuake libXenon repository is located at  
   
 https://github.com/lantus/sdlquake-libxenon  
   
 Download the source and use 'make' to build SDLQuake.  
   
 I've attached a binary with shareware quake as well.  
   
 Enjoy :) [/quote]
