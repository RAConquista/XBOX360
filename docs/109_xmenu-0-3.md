[quote] Xmenu 0.3  
 =========  
   
 Xmenu is an elf loader with a basic gui.  
   
   
 Installation  
 ============  
   
 Copy the file xenon.elf and the "xenon" folder to the root of your usb disk/pen.  
 Load it with the free60.org hack.  
   
   
 Changelog  
 =========  
   
 Version 0.3 :   
 - It's now possible to load custom icons. Put a ".png" image (32 bits, with alpha channel, 32*32 pixels would be better)   
 alongside your executable file, with the ".ico" extension. Example :  
 If you have an executable named "snes9x.elf", put the ".png" icon in the same directory with the name "snes9x.ico".  
   
 Version 0.2 :   
 - Graphics data is now loaded at startup, allowing to customise.   
 - Smaller fonts, this allow more items to be displayed.  
   
 Version 0.1 :  
 - Alpha testing version.  
   
   
 Thanks

I can't get this to work over HDMI, is it supported? I tried compiling with the new toolchain, I get errors, although I have met all requirements (zlib, libpng and SDL, lzx)..

I tried just the distro from the compressed file and could not get it to load on my Glitched Falcon. This would be great to use with everything though. Great work to the creators.

First off, sorry if this is a noob question... I search for an answer I promise.  
 So I used the xenon folder that was under the xmenu.tar\src\lwip\arch\ in conjuction with the xenon.elf file located under the distro folder and I cannot get this to load. Can someone provide a better explanation of what needs to happen here to make this work?  
   
 I think I found my answer in this thread "http://libxenon.org/http://libxenon.org//viewtopic.php?t=0" . Is there a version of xmenu that is being distributed without be compiled?

 I am in the same boat as you. I think the menu would be great.

Finally got this to compile after installing lantus' new libSDLXenon, it did take a couple minor edits. With updated libxenon, you need to change:  
   
 in src/main.c: [code]xenos\_init(); to xenos\_init(VIDEO\_MODE\_AUTO);[/code] and in src/video.c [code]do\_edram\_foo(xe, 1); to //do\_edram\_foo(xe, 1);[/code] Not sure if the latter fix will break the edram init failure you guys are having further..but I see that the author has already commented out do\_edram\_foo in the drawBG function. Without that change, I get "undefined reference to `do\_edram\_foo'" when trying to compile.

@ Tuxuser  
 What is the difference between "zlx-browser" & "Xmenu0.3" ...what would you prefer?  
 I'm using zlx-browser...

I prefer you edit your posts instead of double posting.....  
   
 PS: ZLX
