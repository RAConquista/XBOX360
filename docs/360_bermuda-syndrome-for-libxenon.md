# Bermuda Syndrome for LibXenon

## 2012-09-24 20:13:23, posted by: MagicSeb

Hello, i have a new thing to give you :)  
   
 Based on [url=http://cyxdown.free.fr/bs/]http://cyxdown.free.fr/bs/[/url]   
   
 Compiled with latest libxenon, source code included. You should consider it as a WIP, it works and run but, libvorbis are not included, so no music for the moment.  
   
 You should put "DATA" folder on usb drive and rename it to "bermu", then run it on your xell' 360 ^^  
   
 - Instant save are supported, use START to save and BACK to restore point.  
 - B button let you to "menu" A button is action, etc...  
 - LB for fast forward mode  
   
 I hope you will enjoy this little thing.
