<h3>X360 Firmware ToolBox 4.8</h3>
<br>
<br>
<b>What's new/fixed (since v4.6):</b>
<li>* ADDED: Custom Spoofing Option on "Tools->Spoof Firmware" option (it asks for your 96 bytes inquiry.bin), this could be safer for spoofing drives to Liteon because appears Liteon drives have per-drive specific inquiry response.</li>
<li>If you lost you inquiry.bin file and cannot redump it, then go ahead with listed Liteon spoofing option (it will work but you will not have the factory value).</li>
<li>* ADDED: You can now open key.bin file from main window instead of manually type the key (will ask for a 16 bytes file).
<li>* FIXED: Clicking on firmware file didnt open properly on toolbox.</li>
<li>* ADDED: Spoofing drives to Liteon DG model</li>
<li>* ADDED: Detect/Remove Hardware (DVD-ROM) (on File Menu)</li>
<li>* ADDED: Ixtreme 1.4 No-Check Bit firmware for 79 Drives</li>
<li>* FIXED: Several bugs.</li>
<li>* Note: The No-check bit option for 79 drives is not set as default firmware on Smart hack patcher option, you need to choose it from the list on the Special Firmwares section, the reason is it could be unsafe and lead to M$ detection. </li>
